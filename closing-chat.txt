17:13:54	 From Riley M : major pogchamp in the house
17:13:58	 From Bbarkoff : YAY WILLIAM
17:14:03	 From Alex Studer : Everyone share your favorite problem and why it was one of the ones I wrote
17:14:09	 From Alex Studer : :P
17:14:12	 From Jacob Koziej : coolCPU2
17:14:13	 From Riley M : DSL 800
17:14:16	 From DANIEL KOGAN : YES
17:14:19	 From Riley M : YES
17:14:30	 From Jacob Koziej : bc i'm learning how to write gameboy games in assembly :P
17:14:39	 From Riley M : DSL 800 for sure Alex, because it was fun and the solution was SO SIMPOLE
17:14:45	 From Riley M : I'm just mad I didn't get it sooner :P
17:14:59	 From Jacob Koziej : i wish i didn't waste time on secret agent
17:15:17	 From William Barkoff : Yeah Iâ€™m kind of mad at myself about secret agent - I should have made it easier
17:15:19	 From Jacob Koziej : bc istg i could have done cpu2
17:15:31	 From Alex Studer : Haha yeah the link server one had a lot of steps
17:15:39	 From Alex Studer : You did get it in the end though which was super impressive!
17:15:49	 From Jacob Koziej : how was secret agent meant to be solved in the end?
17:15:55	 From William Barkoff : Iâ€™ll explain nit
17:15:55	 From shaedil : ^
17:15:58	 From William Barkoff : *it rn
17:16:04	 From Riley M : 
It was finding and exploiting the actual bug that was annoying >:(
17:16:21	 From Riley M : Well not exploiting
17:16:23	 From Riley M : Just finding it
17:16:24	 From Alex Studer : and Jacob that's super cool! The coolcpu is actually meant to be similar to old-ish 8-bit processors like the one on the gameboy
17:16:41	 From Riley M : Yeah, I thought so after seeing that you wrote a GB aasembler
17:16:45	 From Riley M : *assembler
17:16:49	 From Riley M : rgbds bad amirite
17:17:00	 From Jacob Koziej : Alex I saw you write z80 and I was so excited
17:17:08	 From Alex Studer : Hahahaha
17:17:18	 From Jacob Koziej : because the A register works really simmilar to the A register on the gbz80
17:17:29	 From Riley M : z80 < COOL CPI
17:17:31	 From Riley M : *CPU
17:17:31	 From Alex Studer : Yep exactly
17:17:34	 From Alex Studer : Yes 100%
17:17:37	 From Jacob Koziej : LMAO
17:18:00	 From Riley M : I solved Cool CPU 1 by doing it by jand.
17:18:06	 From Riley M : I considered making an assembler
17:18:09	 From Riley M : Here's my code:
17:18:18	 From Alex : wrote a script in python to just get the values to read all the bytes from memory
17:18:24	 From Jacob Koziej : i was gonna do coolCPU2 in assembler and then just run a vim macro to convert it into hex
17:18:30	 From Riley M : 22 93
05
12 F1
20
32 02
FF
17:18:34	 From Riley M : It ends iup reading more
17:18:37	 From Riley M : But it still works
17:18:38	 From Riley M : :P
17:19:06	 From Alex : lol get em with that slack
17:19:11	 From Riley M : slack pog?
17:19:14	 From Riley M : slack pog
17:19:28	 From Alex Studer : Yeah it turns out writing null bytes doesn't hurt anything so you can just print out whatever lol
17:19:33	 From Riley M : lol yeah
17:19:34	 From Jacob Koziej : irc >> slack
17:19:39	 From shaedil : lol
17:19:51	 From Alex Studer : And for coolcpu2 it's annoying without an assembler
17:19:59	 From Jacob Koziej : that is true
17:19:59	 From Riley M : I'll probably publish my DSL client if anyone wants to take a look
17:20:09	 From Riley M : sure :)
17:20:17	 From Jacob Koziej : Riley sent me some of his hex and i had to convert it to hex lol
17:20:17	 From Alex Studer : Yes please do!
17:20:25	 From William Barkoff : CON 0x93 ; stores 0x93 in register A
	DEC
	SWB
loop:
	SWB ; puts current position back in register A
	INC
	LDB ; loads value at current position into register B 
	STB 0xf1 ; outputs value at register B
	SWB ; swaps a and b
	JNZ loop	; stop CPU
	HCF
17:20:36	 From Jacob Koziej : nice
17:21:01	 From Alex Studer : 	CON 0x93				; 22 93
loop: 			; this will be at position 0x02
	LDB [A]					; 05
	SWB						; 40
	JZ end					; 31 0C
	SWB						; 40
	STB 0xF1				; 12 F1
	INC						; 20
	JP loop					; 30 02
end:			; this will be at position 0x0C
	HCF						; FF
17:21:04	 From Bbarkoff : tHANK YOU
