Hi! I'm [William Barkoff](https://willbarkoff.dev), and HackDalton is my [Senior Initiative](https://www.dalton.org/programs/high-school/curriculum/the-senior-year). I am being advised by [Charlie Stewart](https://github.com/cforster). I've written most of the HackDalton problems, with the exception of those written by our [guest problem writers](/guest-problem-writers.html).

Hopefully, HackDalton will bring people together during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Source Code
Right now, some of HackDalton's source code is on our [GitHub organazation](https://github.com/hackdalton); however, after the competition is complete, we plan to post all of the problems that have been created, along with writeups on their solutions.
