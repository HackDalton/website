1. **HackDalton is a friendly and respectful place.** Treat others how you would like to be treated. Users may be banned from HackDalton for not treating others respectfully on the competition platform (game.hackdalton.com, problems.hackdalton.com, problems-*.hackdalton.com), the help website (help.hackdalton.com), or any other HackDalton website.
2. **Stay in bounds.** The only sites in-bounds for the competiton are problems.hackdalton.com and problems-*.hackdalton.org, where the * is replaced with a certian string. You will be wasting your time, as no flags can be found anywhere outside of those sites, and potentially interrupting the game for other players.
3. **Flags will be in a specific format.** All competiton flags will be in the format `hackDalton{}`, where there is a series of numbers, letters, and symbols between the `{` and `}` characters. If your flag isn't in that format, it is incorrect.
4. **Easier problems unlock more difficult problems.** Some problems are hidden until you complete prior problems.
5. **Hints cost points.** If you need a hint, you can use one of the pre-written hints for a fixed amount of points, displayed prior to opening the hint.
6. **In person help is free.** Questions asked on help.hackdalton.com do not cost any points; though, there may be a delay before they can be answered. Do not publically post answers or hints on help.hackdalton.com. If you're not sure whether or not a post should be public, make it private.
7. **Only students can participate.** Only high school students can participate. If you're a teacher and would like to participate, email us at [hi@hackdalton.com](hi@hackdalton.com), and we can set up an account for you.
7. We reserve the right to ban any team or person from the competition for any reason.
